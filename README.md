# FingerCNC

One dimensional CNC machine controller for making finger (aka. box aka. comb) joints on a table saw.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_joint

## The Goal

I want to be able to make fingerjoints on my table saw, using
Matthias Wandels box joint jig as inspiration, but with a micro controller
doing the calculations rather than messing about with hand-carved gears.

## The Electronics

To make purcashing easy I have chosen the plunk down the money for kit with:
* RAMPS 1.4  http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4
* Mega2560
* ST7920 128x64 pixel LCD  http://reprap.org/mediawiki/images/5/51/RRD_FULL_GRAPHIC_SMART_CONTROLER_SCHEMATIC.pdf
* 5x A4988 stepper drivers

This kit is crazy overkill, but it's also crazy cheap as it's mass-produced for 3D printers, so it's faster and cheaper to source all the parts with such a kit rather than go out and build a dedicated controller with only the bare minimum parts needed, someone dedicated enough to mass-production could probably optimize away most of the parts of this kit and use a much smaller MCU, but done beats perfect, so kit it is:

To clearly indicate state (moving/free to cut) I'll use a strip of RGBW LEDS hooked to PB5.

I'll use the encoder to control all aspects of the UI.

## The Mechanics

I purchased a TR8*2 trapezoidal lead screw with an anti-backlash nut and a stepper motor from robotdigg, but any screw would probably do.

## Pinout

These are the signals used by the firmware, some of which I have traced through 4 schematics to end up with the real AVR pin name, annoying how everybody who makes a board wants to rename every signal to something new.

The AKA. column refers to the name of the signal on the smart adaptor or the RAMPS connector

## The serial port

The serial port accessible via the USB runs at 1 Mbps, because that's the highest baud rate
possible at 16 MHz and there's no baud-rate error, unlike the more standard 115200.


## Feature numbering

This is the numbering of fingers and spaces for the two boards:

Each space is made with a number of cuts.
The home location of the blade is to the left of finger/space 0.
The first cut on board A is the left edge of space 0.
The first cut on board B is the left edge of space 1.
